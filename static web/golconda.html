                    The Taj Mahal is an iconic 17th-century mausoleum located in Agra, India,
                    commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, 
                    Mumtaz Mahal. Built entirely of white marble and adorned with intricate 
                    carvings and precious stones, it reflects a blend of Persian, Islamic, 
                    and Indian architectural styles. Surrounded by lush gardens and set beside
                    the Yamuna River, the monument changes color with the sunlight, symbolizing
                    the timeless beauty and love it was built to honor. Recognized as a UNESCO
                    World Heritage Site, it attracts millions of visitors each year as one of
                    the worlds most celebrated wonders.
