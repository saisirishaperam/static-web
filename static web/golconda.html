                <p class="dis">
                    Golconda Fort, located in Hyderabad, Telangana, is a historic fortress known for its impressive architecture,
                     rich history, and strategic location. Originally built in the 12th century by the Kakatiya dynasty, it was
                      later expanded by the Qutb Shahi rulers into a massive stronghold. The fort is famous for its ingenious 
                      acoustic system—clapping at the entrance can be heard at the highest point of the fort, which served as a
                       warning signal in ancient times.
                    Golconda was once a flourishing diamond trading center, home to some of the world’s most famous gems, including the Koh-i-Noor. 
                    Its massive gates, bastions, palaces, and water supply system showcase advanced engineering skills of the time. 
                    Surrounded by granite walls up to 11 km in circumference, the fort offers panoramic views of Hyderabad and stands
                     as a reminder of the region’s glorious past.
