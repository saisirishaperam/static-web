                    Araku Valley is a picturesque hill station nestled in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh,
                    India, known for its cool climate, lush green landscapes, and serene beauty. Surrounded by
                    coffee plantations, dense forests, waterfalls, and tribal villages, it offers a perfect 
                    escape for nature lovers and adventure seekers. The valley is also home to the Borra Caves,
                    famous for their stunning stalactite and stalagmite formations. With its scenic train journey
                    through tunnels and bridges, Araku is often called the "Ooty of Andhra Pradesh" and is a 
                    popular year-round tourist destination.
